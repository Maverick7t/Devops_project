## ðŸ“Œ Phase 2: Source Code Integration (Version Control Setup)

This phase connects the DevOps pipeline with real-world source code and prepares it for automation:

- Created a **private GitHub repository** for a Java-based microservice
- Configured **GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)** for secure authentication (no passwords)
- Cloned the repo, added project files, and pushed code to the cloud
- Integrated GitHub with Jenkins using stored credentials so Jenkins can pull the latest code securely
- Confirmed version control integration by triggering Jenkins builds from source changes

ðŸŽ¯ *Goal*: Establish secure, automated version control as the single source of truth for deployment.
